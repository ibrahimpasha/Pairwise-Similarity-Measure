<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2>MIDDLETON'S RESOLVE</h2>


<p>"I shall go down to Wokingham", said Middleton, "a few days 
before the election, and the Major will stay here. I 
understand that there will be no other candidate, and <i>I</i>
shall take the seat.</p>

<p>"The Major is a . . . <i>fl&acirc;neur</i>. He has no interest beyond 
his own advancement. I can buy him for a hundred pounds. 
<i>Here</i> is his answer."</p>

<p>Wallace wondered at the <i>hubris</i> of his friend, and 
examined the note Middleton thrust upon him.</p>

<p>"Sir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No consideration would induce me to
change my resolve in this matter, but I am
willing to engage your services as my agent
for a fee of &pound;100.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. Middleton"</p>



<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2>THE ELECTION</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---- BYRON</p>

<p>On hearing of Middleton's visit, Mr. Wentworth began his 
preparations. Meeting with Thomas Lake and Riley at the 
back of the tap-room of The Bull &amp; Gate&mdash;where the landlord
saw to it that they remained undisturbed&mdash;he laid out their
plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"That d---l Middleton shall not have the seat," he raved,
"not for Lord H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; no, nor for a hundred Lords! We 
shall see to it that every man's hand is turned against
him when he arrives."</p>

<p>Lake unfolded a paper from his vest-pocket and smoothed it
on the table. "Here are the expenses we should undertake."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doran           &pound;13 10s.<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titwell         &pound; 8  7s. 6d.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Charles     &pound;25<br>
